Finally saw the [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](https://www.nyse.com/index) closing bell in person.

Met a floor trader (seat holder) who has been working on the floor since 1985. It's surprisingly quiet! If it wasn't for CNBC and visitors, you could whisper to talk. 

Last pic is of a defaulted Russian imperial bond. I'm not sure why it's prominently displayed there.
