The clearest thinking I do rarely happens in front of a screen. Time spent exploring, training, and hanging out with the people (and dog) I love is what keeps my professional work sharp.

## Exploring

I chase big landscapes whenever I can: camping on the crater of an active volcano in the Congo, a two week motorcycle loop through Patagonia, and slow days wandering the rock formations of the White Pocket or the South Kaibab trail in the Grand Canyon. Not every adventure has to be intense — sometimes it is just me being a tourist, hanging with llamas in Bolivia.

## Staying Active

Movement is the through line. I grew up with an ultramarathon runner for a dad, so logging Central Park laps, racing a couple of half Ironmans (Wildflower included), and sneaking in powder days at Vail feels normal. Training miles double as thinking time, and the discipline transfers directly into how I build models.

## Appreciating Art and Architecture

Creativity and structure coexist when you study great architecture. I am a sucker for a Santiago Calatrava design because it is a reminder that elegant engineering can be emotional. That same balance is what I aim for in my research.

## Spending Time with Friends and Family

The best stories come from long time friends and my Aussiedoodle, Dapple. Thirty year friendships, relentless games of fetch, and board duties at Stuyvesant Square Park are the grounding forces that make the rest of life work.

## Why It Matters

Whether I am running trails, studying architecture, or trading dad jokes with my kids, those experiences feed back into how I solve problems at work. Staying curious outside the office keeps me adaptable when markets get weird.
