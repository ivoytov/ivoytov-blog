## Career Journey

- Broke into finance at JPMorgan in 2006, working on six high-yield deals inside the top ranked Leveraged Finance group.  
- Spent nearly thirteen years at Vector Capital in San Francisco leading research, posting a 2.7 Sharpe ratio, 13% net returns, and raising $327MM of new LP capital.  
- Founded Bankrupt11 in 2020, scaling the legal tech platform to 25K monthly active users within a year while hitting breakeven profitability.  
- Built elevated return models at Elevation Securities before joining Lazard Asset Management as Senior Vice President.

## Current Role

At [Lazard](https://www.lazardassetmanagement.com/us/en_us/home) I design quantitative research models for the Lazard Equity Advantage platform. It is a blend of fifteen years of fundamental work plus three years of quant development, deployed across institutional strategies that trade more than $20B in equity value.

## Life in Manhattan

I live in Manhattan with my two kids and serve on the board of Stuyvesant Square Park. Outside office hours I am usually digging into NYC real estate, sharing foreclosure opportunities with the 1,300+ people who follow me on [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@goilya), or sneaking away to surf the Rockaways and run Central Park.

## Investment Philosophy

I look for alpha at the intersections:

- Pair legal analysis with quantitative models.  
- Apply technology to legacy finance workflows.  
- Feed fundamental research back into algorithmic strategies.

After two decades in markets I have learned that durable performance comes from systems that adapt as conditions shift.
